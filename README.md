# nix-config
My NixOS configuration files

## Usage

- Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname` to apply your system
  configuration.
    - If you're still on a live installation medium, run `nixos-install --flake
      .#hostname` instead, and reboot.
- Run `home-manager switch --flake .#username@hostname` to apply your home
  configuration.
  - If you don't have home-manager installed, try `nix shell nixpkgs#home-manager`.

And that's it, really! You're ready to have fun with your configurations using
the latest and greatest nix3 flake-enabled command UX.
